# Cancer Rate Analysis with Self-Balancing AVL Trees

## Author: Kyan Kotschevar-Smead

### Project Overview

This project is dedicated to the efficient analysis of cancer rate data using self-balancing AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) trees. The primary objective in PA3 is to achieve an optimal time complexity of O(logn) for in-order insertion. This is a critical focus, as conventional sorting algorithms can be computationally expensive, particularly with large, unordered datasets.

### Key Features
- Efficient insertion of cancer rate data into self-balancing AVL trees.
- Maintains optimal time complexity (O(logn)) for in-order insertion.
- Handles unordered datasets for seamless data analysis.

This project offers a practical solution for efficiently managing and analyzing disordered cancer rate data, ensuring that even with substantial datasets, the time complexity remains low.

### How to Run

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Configure the project settings as needed.
3. Build and run the project.
